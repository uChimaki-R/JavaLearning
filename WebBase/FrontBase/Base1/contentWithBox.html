            <b>Arthur Engoron</b> hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined
            the
            former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business
            records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he
            stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion
            that
            painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again
