        <b>Arthur Engoron</b> hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the
        former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.

        Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business
        records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he
        stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that
        painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again
